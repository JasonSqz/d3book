# General Advice <i class="fa fa-bug"></i>

## Debugging Tips 

* Make extensive use of Elements to see what's being added to the DOM.

* Make extensive use of Console to check the values of variables and/or test code.

* Pay attention to errors in the Console. 

* Use `console.log()` esp. in functions

* Post Minimal Working Examples on Ed Discussion in Canvas. See:

    ["How to create a Minimal, Complete, and Verifiable example"](https://stackoverflow.com/help/mcve){target="_blank"}

    (But don't worry if it's not perfect, we're not going to judge.)

* Use a text editor that helps you identify unmatched () {} [].
